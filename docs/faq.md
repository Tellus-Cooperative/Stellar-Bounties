# FAQ

## General Questions

**Do I need a Passport account?**  
Yes. Passport verifies your identity and enables payouts. You must link your Passport account to your GitHub account via OAuth to participate in bounties.

**How do I get started with Passport?**  
Visit the Passport website to create an account and connect your GitHub profile. The verification process typically takes a few minutes.

**What if I don't have a Stellar wallet?**  
Passport will help you create a wallet during the onboarding process. You can also use existing Stellar wallets that support the required features.

## Payout Questions

**How are payouts handled?**  
Q4 2025: Manual XLM payouts to Passport wallets after maintainer approval. Processing typically takes 3â€“7 days after the `payout-approved` label is applied.

**When will automated payouts be available?**  
Automated payout processing is planned for January 2026, with policy engine and on-chain receipt posting.

**What if my payout is delayed?**  
Contact the bounty maintainers or support team if your payout is delayed beyond 7 days. Most delays are due to verification requirements or technical issues.

**Can I receive payouts in other currencies?**  
Currently, all payouts are in XLM. Future support for other currencies may be added based on community demand.

## Competition & Submissions

**What if two PRs solve the same issue?**  
Maintainers select the earliest high-quality PR that fully meets all Acceptance Criteria. In judged bounties, the best implementation wins regardless of timing.

**What if my PR is partially accepted?**  
Partial awards are possible at maintainer discretion. The bounty will be labeled `partial-award` with a reduced payout amount based on the value delivered.

**Can I work on multiple bounties simultaneously?**  
Yes, but ensure you can meet the deadlines and quality requirements for each. Focus on completing one bounty well rather than starting many.

**What if I can't complete a bounty I claimed?**  
Release your claim by commenting on the bounty issue. Inactive claims may be automatically released after 7 days without progress.

## Technical Questions

**What is the proof JSON block?**  
A cryptographic proof generated by the Passport app that verifies your identity and links your submission to your Passport account. It's required in all PR bodies.

**How do I generate the proof JSON block?**  
Use the Passport app to generate the proof after creating your PR. The app will provide the properly formatted JSON block to include in your PR description.

**What if the proof verification fails?**  
Ensure your Passport account is properly linked to GitHub, the JSON block is correctly formatted, and you've claimed the bounty before submitting. Contact support if issues persist.

**Can I submit bounties for repositories not in the allowlist?**  
No. Only repositories in the approved allowlist can have bounties. See [`repo-allowlist-guidelines.md`](repo-allowlist-guidelines.md) for criteria.

## Campaign & Timing

**When do campaigns open?**  
Campaigns are announced in this repository and on official Stellar channels. Follow the repository for notifications about new bounty opportunities.

**How long do bounties stay open?**  
Bounty duration varies by complexity and urgency. Check the `closes_at` field in each bounty's front-matter for specific deadlines.

**What happens if a bounty expires?**  
Expired bounties are automatically closed. Unclaimed bounties may be reopened with extended deadlines or modified requirements.

**Can I request extensions for bounties?**  
Extensions may be granted at maintainer discretion for valid reasons (technical difficulties, scope clarification, etc.). Contact maintainers before the deadline.
