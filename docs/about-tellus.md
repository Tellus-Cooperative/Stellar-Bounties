# About Tellus Cooperative Foundation

## Mission

The Tellus Cooperative Foundation operates the Stellar Passport Bounties program to support public goods development in the Stellar ecosystem. Our mission is to foster community-driven development while ensuring fair compensation for contributors.

## Values

### Public Goods Focus
We prioritize funding repositories that serve as public goods - infrastructure, tools, and documentation that benefit the entire Stellar ecosystem rather than individual for-profit companies.

### Community-Driven Development
Our bounties program empowers community members to contribute meaningfully to projects they care about, with fair compensation for their valuable work.

### Transparency & Fairness
All bounty processes, criteria, and decisions are transparent. We maintain clear guidelines and provide fair review processes for all contributors.

### Quality & Sustainability
We emphasize high-quality contributions that follow best practices, include proper testing, and maintain long-term sustainability of the projects they support.

## Impact

### Supporting Ecosystem Growth
By funding critical infrastructure and developer tools, we help accelerate the growth of the Stellar ecosystem and make it easier for developers to build on Stellar.

### Empowering Contributors
Our bounties provide meaningful opportunities for developers to contribute to open source while receiving fair compensation for their expertise and time.

### Reducing Maintenance Burden
By funding bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development, we help reduce the maintenance burden on project maintainers and improve project sustainability.

## Governance

### Cooperative Structure
As a cooperative foundation, we operate with democratic principles and community input in our decision-making processes.

### Stakeholder Representation
Our governance includes representation from:
- Stellar ecosystem developers
- Project maintainers
- Community contributors
- Technical advisors

### Transparent Operations
All our operations, including bounty funding decisions, are conducted transparently with public documentation and community input opportunities.
