# Summary

Enhance the Soroban smart contract development documentation with clearer examples, better structure, and improved beginner-friendly explanations.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Improve the "Getting Started with Soroban" guide
- Add more practical examples for common contract patterns
- Enhance code examples with better comments
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Improve the contract deployment walkthrough
- Add links to relevant tools and resources

### Out of Scope
- Complete rewrite of existing documentation
- Changes to API reference documentation
- Video content or multimedia
- Translation to other languages

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation builds without errors
- [ ] All code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Examples include proper error handling
- [ ] Beginner concepts are clearly explained
- [ ] Links to external resources are valid
- [ ] Code examples follow best practices
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed for clarity
- [ ] No broken internal links

## Getting Started

- Review the [current Soroban documentation](https://docs.stellar.org/docs/soroban/)
- Check the [docs repository structure](https://github.com/stellar/docs)
- Look at existing examples in the `docs/soroban/` directory
- Consider common questions from the community

## Testing & Verification

1. Clone the docs repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build documentation: `npm run build`
4. Start local server: `npm run dev`
5. Verify all examples work as documented
6. Check for broken links: `npm run check-links`
7. Review content for clarity and accuracy
