# Summary

Fix TypeScript type definitions in the Soroban SDK for contract invocation methods to properly handle generic types and improve developer experience.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Update TypeScript definitions in `src/contract.ts`
- Fix generic type constraints for contract method calls
- Improve type inference for contract parameters and return values
- Add proper JSDoc comments with examples
- Update related test files to verify type correctness
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### Out of Scope
- Changes to runtime behavior
- Breaking changes to public API
- Documentation website updates
- Performance optimizations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] Type definitions properly infer generic contract types
- [ ] Existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] New tests verify type correctness
- [ ] JSDoc comments include usage examples
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] IDE autocomplete works correctly

## Getting Started

- Review the [Soroban SDK documentation](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk)
- Examine current type definitions in `src/contract.ts`
- Check existing issues related to TypeScript types
- Look at contract invocation examples in the test suite

## Testing & Verification

1. Clone the js-stellar-sdk repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Verify type checking: `npm run type-check`
6. Test with sample contract invocation code
7. Verify IDE autocomplete functionality

- [Contract Call Type Inference Problems](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/issues/812)

## Technical Details

The issue involves the `invokeContract` method and related functions not properly inferring generic types when calling contract methods. The fix should maintain the existing API while improving type safety and developer experience.

## Additional Notes

This is a judged bounty - multiple contributors may submit solutions, and the best implementation will be selected based on code quality, type safety, and maintainability.
