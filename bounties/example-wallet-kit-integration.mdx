# Summary

Implement a reusable QR code scanner component for the Wallet Kit that can scan Stellar addresses, transaction XDRs, and other Stellar-related QR codes.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Create a new `QRScanner` component in `src/components/`
- Support scanning Stellar addresses (G... format)
- Support scanning transaction XDR strings
- Provide proper error handling for invalid QR codes
- Include TypeScript types and proper prop interfaces
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Update component documentation

### Out of Scope
- Camera permission handling (assume granted)
- Custom QR code generation
- Offline QR code validation
- Integration with specific wallet implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Component builds without TypeScript errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New component has >90% test coverage
- [ ] Component follows Wallet Kit design patterns
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples
- [ ] Component is accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Error states are properly handled and displayed
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on mobile devices

## Getting Started

- Review existing Wallet Kit components for patterns
- Check [Wallet Kit documentation](https://github.com/stellar/wallet-kit)
- Look at similar QR scanner implementations in the ecosystem
- Start with the component scaffold in `src/components/QRScanner.tsx`

## Testing & Verification

1. Clone the wallet-kit repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. Test QR scanning with sample Stellar addresses
6. Verify error handling with invalid QR codes
7. Check mobile responsiveness

- [QR Code Standards for Stellar](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/456)

## Additional Notes

The component should be framework-agnostic and work with React, Vue, and other frameworks that Wallet Kit supports. Focus on clean, reusable code that follows the established patterns in the repository.
